## !!! Please See The Whitespace Corpus Project Instead !!!

This had been a collection of interpreters for the "whitespace" programming
language, collected from the Internet.

It has been superseded by a larger project:

  https://github.com/wspace/corpus

Hence this repository is now archived and read-only.  For those searching for
the Ren-C/Rebol implementation that was developed here, it is now maintained
separately:

  https://github.com/hostilefork/rebol-whitespacers

For more information on the Whitespace language, see:
